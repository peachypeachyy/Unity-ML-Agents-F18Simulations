# Unity-ML-Agents-F18Simulations
The repository features simulations of an aircraft such as F18 on an Aircraft carrier.
Note this only contains the Assets of the Individual project and not the assets of the Entire Unity Library.
The Project uses ML-Agents from Unity with PPO Optimization to optimize aircraft landings.
